Here I summarized some tips about Octopress:

- Easy setup by following [Octopress Setup](http://octopress.org/docs/setup/)
- Nice deploy by following [Deploying to Github Pages](http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/)
- Simple configuration by following [Configuring Octopress](http://octopress.org/docs/configuring/)
- Beautiful post by following [Blogging Basics](http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/)
- Programmer oriented, see [Sharing Code Snippets](http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/code/) and [Plugins](http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/plugins/)

One drawback:

- May need to upgrade or downgrade to a specific jekyll version to generate posts correctly, that's why it is called 'A blogging framework for hackers'

One convenient tool to write markdown post is Mou. Try it!
