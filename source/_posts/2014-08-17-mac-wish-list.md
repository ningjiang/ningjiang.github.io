Mac could be better, if it can:

- Provide a package management system, e.g. [homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
- Enhance the terminal, e.g. [iTerm2](http://iterm2.com/)
- Friendly Bash shell, e.g. Dir Colors, Bash Prompt, especially *Bash Completion*
- More powerful commands, the default commands are of less use
- A configured VIM editor, at lease *'syntax on'*

Well, maybe I'm a little spoiled by Ubuntu development environment :-)
